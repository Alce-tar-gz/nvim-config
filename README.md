# nvim-config
This is my own configuration of neovim
# It includes
- A File Finder (Telescope)
- Markdown rendering (I'm using it right now to write this boring README)
- Nordic Theme (Like Nord, but darker and uses Aurora more than Frost)
- QoL Improvements (Noice, Which-key, Lualine, Bufferline)
- A Home screen (Alpha)
# Installation
Install the latest Release or Pre-Release on macOS, Linux or BSD
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alce-tar-gz/nvim-config/refs/heads/main/setup.sh)"
```
If you want a specific release, download the `setup.sh` script on the release page and run it
